## Architecture

![Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3871a65-7d2e-4b00-97dc-a2bc42477dc7)

Shadow is built on Ramses V3 Core, which is based on Uniswap V3, with several enhancements. These improvements include [dynamic system and protocol fee mechanisms](/pages/x-33#fees), [FeeShareâ„¢](/pages/x-33#fee-share), and [x(3,3)](/pages/x-33). Ramses V3 Core also introduces a new accounting system to track how much active liquidity each concentrated liquidity position provides.
