# Top-Level Contracts

1. `AccessHub.sol`
   Role: Central authority and access control manager for the protocol.
   Features: Manages roles (e.g., SWAP_FEE_SETTER, PROTOCOL_OPERATOR), stores important contract addresses, and provides functions for protocol configuration (fee splits, treasury, timelock, etc).
   Pattern: Uses OpenZeppelin's AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable for role-based permissions.

2. `FeeDistributor.sol`
   Role: Handles distribution of protocol fees to participants.
   Features: Tracks balances, rewards, and votes over periods; interacts with voter and plugin contracts.

3. `FeeRecipient.sol`
   Role: Receives and splits fees for a specific pair.
   Features: Binds to a pair and voter, notifies and approves fee distribution.

4. `Gauge.sol`
   Role: Incentivizes pools by distributing rewards for staked LP tokens.
   Features: Manages staking, rewards, and interacts with voter and xShadow contracts.

5. `LauncherPlugin.sol`
   Role: Modular plugin system for pool launchers.
   Features: Manages authorities, operators, and plugin enablement for pools.

6. `Minter.sol`
   Role: Controls emissions and minting of the protocol token.
   Features: Manages emission rates, supply caps, operator permissions.

7. `Pair.sol`
   Role: Core AMM pool contract.
   Features: Manages liquidity, swaps, oracles, and fee recipients for token pairs.

8. `Router.sol`
   Role: Main entrypoint for users to interact with pools (add/remove liquidity, swap).
   Features: Handles routing, token sorting, WETH integration, and path validation.

9. `Shadow.sol`
   Role: ERC20 token contract for the protocol.
   Features: Mintable, burnable, and supports permit (EIP-2612).

10. `ShadowTimelock.sol`
    Role: Timelock controller for governance actions.
    Features: Inherits OpenZeppelin's TimelockController.

11. `TimelockedTransparentUpgradableProxy.sol`
    Role: Upgradeable proxy with timelock.
    Features: Uses OpenZeppelin's proxy and admin patterns for secure upgrades.

12. `VoteModule.sol`
    Role: Handles voting, staking, and reward distribution for governance.
    Features: Manages staking, cooldowns, and reward calculations.

13. `Voter.sol`
    Role: Central contract for governance and voting.
    Features: Manages gauges, pools, voting, and distribution logic.

## Key Subdirectories

- CL: Likely contains concentrated liquidity logic (e.g., Uniswap v3-style pools, gauges, and interfaces).
- factories: Factory contracts for deploying instances of pools, gauges, or other protocol modules.
- interfaces: Interface definitions for all protocol contracts, ensuring modularity and upgradability.
- libraries: Shared utility libraries.
- xShadow: Likely contains contracts related to the xShadow staking/locking mechanism.
